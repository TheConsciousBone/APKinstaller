Hello! This is a simple APK installer that uses ADB. 


To use it, download the .exe file from the releases page and make sure your ADB files are at the path: C:\adb
If they aren't, the script will fail.

Make sure the Android device connected has USB debugging enabled, otherwise the script will not be able to install the APK.
