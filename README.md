Hello! This is a simple APK installer that uses ADB. To use it, download the .py file and make sure your ADB files are at this path: C:\adb
If they aren't, the script will fail.
Make sure you also downloaded the executer.bat file if you want a more simple way to run the Python script.
Make sure the executer.bat and the APKinstaller.py files are in the same location (e.g. the same folder) for the executer to work.
